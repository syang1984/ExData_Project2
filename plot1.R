# Question 1:
# Have total emissions from PM2.5 decreased in the United States from 1999 to
# 2008? Using the base plotting system, make a plot showing the total PM2.5
# emission from all sources for each of the years 1999, 2002, 2005, and 2008.


# Load the NEI & SCC data frames.
NEI <- readRDS("summarySCC_PM25.rds")
SCC <- readRDS("Source_Classification_Code.rds")

# Aggregate by sum the total emissions by year
aggTotals <- aggregate(Emissions ~ year,NEI, sum)
