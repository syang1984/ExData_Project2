# Question 3:
# Of the four types of sources indicated by the type (point, nonpoint, onroad,
# nonroad) variable, which of these four sources have seen decreases in
# emissions from 1999–2008 for Baltimore City? Which have seen increases in
# emissions from 1999–2008? Use the ggplot2 plotting system to make a plot
# answer this question.

# Load the NEI & SCC data frames.
NEI <- readRDS("summarySCC_PM25.rds")
SCC <- readRDS("Source_Classification_Code.rds")

# Subset NEI data by Baltimore's fip.
baltimoreNEI <- NEI[NEI$fips=="24510",]

# Aggregate using sum the Baltimore emissions data by year
aggTotalsBaltimore <- aggregate(Emissions ~ year, baltimoreNEI,sum)
